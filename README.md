> ### Codespaces Browser App
>
> If you are using Edge or Chrome you will see an option to install the Codespaces app when you launch your Codespaces. The Codespaces app lets you launch your Codespaces within the app so you can work outside of the browser.  Look for the app icon and install pop-up to try it out.
